**Q1:** Q1: Who is this course designed for?

This course is designed for researchers, bioinformaticians, and students who want to learn how to analyze scRNA-Seq data using the R programming language. It is suitable for individuals with a basic understanding of molecular biology concepts and some familiarity with R.

**Q2:** What background knowledge do I need to take this course?

Participants should have a basic understanding of molecular biology and genetics concepts. Some familiarity with R programming will be helpful, but not mandatory.


**Q3:** Will I need any software or tools for the course?

Yes, you will need access to R and RStudio, which are commonly used for data analysis in R. You'll also use various R packages for scRNA-Seq analysis, such as `Seurat`.

**Q4:** 4. What topics will be covered in this course?

The course covers scRNA-Seq technology, experimental design, data preprocessing, quality control, read alignment, gene expression estimation, differential expression analysis, alternative splicing, normalization, functional enrichment analysis, and reproducible research practices.

**Q5:** Will I be working with real data?

Yes, the course includes hands-on exercises using real scRNA-Seq datasets. This practical experience will help you apply the concepts you learn to actual data.

**Q6:** How will I be assessed in the course?

Assessment methods may include quizzes, assignments, and a final project where you'll analyze an RNA-Seq dataset on your own and present your findings.

**Q7:** Is the course self-paced or instructor-led?
It as an instructor-led course with set schedules, while others might offer it for self-paced learning.


**Q8:** How long is the course?
The duration of the course: 8 days.
